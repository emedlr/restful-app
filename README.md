Micro RESTful webservice
========================

Sloppy try to make a RESTful app with Silex. Made in one hour.

Installation
------------

1. Download [composer][1]: `curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php`

2. Run: `php composer.phar install`

Routes
------

This service open the doors through two ways:

Route: `/api/comments`

Method: `POST`

Recieves a JSON object post call and saves it into database.

Route: `/api/comments`

Method: `GET`

Fetch all comments from database and returns it as JSON object.

Route: `/test`

Method: `GET`

There is a third route that allows you to test the service, with a simple jQuery `$.ajax` function.
